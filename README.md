# Capstone-project
The Capstone project combine what we have learned in the preceding courses on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. The project includes 2 main parts with subtasks inside:

1- Data Exploration and Analysis using SQL, Spreadsheets and Tableau

2- Presentation of your findings and insights.

<b>Project Background</b>

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.
Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 owners who are very invested in their business. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly next few months.

Our task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.
